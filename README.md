# School Work

This repository includes some of the code I've done during my studies. Here's a short intro to each one.

## Ohjelmoinnin-perusteet
Basics of programming -course with Python. My first touch to actual programming language (if you don't count some earlier HTML and CSS stuff).
I'm really proud of the Mickey (Excercise_week_10_MICKEY.py) thing I created. First real achievement in Python I'm sure.

## Object-oriented-programming
OOP was my first programming course which was more challenging. I learned properly in what order the code is actually run and of course what are objects and how to use them. Although this course took more effort and time, it was rewarding to see the program I did working correctly.

## Tietokannat
In this course I learned about MySQL databases and how to design and create/edit them. 

## Web-tekniikoiden-perusteet
This web development course has been one of my favorite courses. It covered HTML5, CSS and some JavaScript. In this course I got a great recap of web dev tools and languages as I had some experience already. I took another JavaScript course as well to cover that area better. Currently I'm further improving my skills in Full Stack Open course.

## DSA
aka data structures & algorithms. These exercises were a part of AI and Machine Learning -course.
